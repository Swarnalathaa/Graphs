# Graphs

A graph is an abstract data type. A graph is defined by:
1) Vertices : V = {v1,v2,.......,vj}
2) Edges : Connects the vertices {vi,vj}
3) Degree : Number of adjacent vertices

The graph can be Directed or Undirected

I have implemented this abstract data type by :

1)Adjacency Matrix and calculated the in and out degrees of each node/vertex
2)Adjacency list and implemented traversal algorithm like BFS and DFS and checked whether the graph is strongly connected or not
